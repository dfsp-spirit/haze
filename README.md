# smoothr
Fast smoothing of per-vertex data on triangular meshes for R.


## About

This package performs smoothing of per-vertex data:

![Vis](./web/smoothr.jpg?raw=true "Per-vertex data on a brain mesh before (left) and after (right) smoothing.")
Fig.1: Per-vertex data on a brain mesh before (left) and after (right) smoothing.

To avoid any confusion: `smoothr` does **not** smooth the mesh itself (use the `Rvcg` R package for that).

## Usage

This is WIP, come back another day.
