haze Changes
=============


Version 0.1.0 -- Initial release
---------------------------------
Initial release. The following features are currently implemented:
* `pervertexdata.smoothnn()` and related functions: nearest neighbor smoothing based on edge distance (e.g., `k`-ring neighborhood of each vertex, with arbitrary `k`).
* `submesh.vertex()`: Creation of a sub mesh based on vertex indices in the source mesh (known as a *patch* in FreeSurfer).
* `find_nv_kdtree()`: Find nearest mesh vertex for query coordinates using a *k*-d tree.
* `nn_interpolate_kdtree()`: Get per-vertex data at vertices closest to the given query coordinates on the mesh.
* `linear_interpolate_kdtree()`: Interpolate per-vertex data at the query points. Can be used to map per-vertex data between subjects (for which you have spherical, aligned meshes).

Note that this is NOT available on CRAN, the package size if >50 MB and CRAN only supports 5 MB.
